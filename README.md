🎧 Spotify Listening Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

📌 Overview:
This project analyzes Spotify streaming data to uncover user listening behavior across albums, artists, and tracks. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard to identify trends, top performers, and engagement patterns across time, days, and listening sessions.

⭐ Importance:
In today’s digital music landscape, platforms like Spotify thrive on data-driven insights. This project simulates how analytics can:
Help platforms personalize user recommendations
Inform record labels on popular content
Understand changing user behavior over time
